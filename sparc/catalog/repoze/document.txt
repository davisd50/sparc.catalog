# Repoze Catalog document map factory
In order to use the Repoze catalog facilities, we need to be able to generate
and track integer-based Ids for catalog'd objects.  Since sparc.entity based
objects have ASCII Ids...we need some facility that will be able to create
a unique integer id for those objects and track them for later lookup.

The repoze.catalog.document.DocumentMap class will perform this for us.  We'll
do some basic testing for it here.

>>> from zope.component import createObject
>>> doc_map = createObject('sparc.catalog.repoze.document_map')

>>> from sparc.catalog.repoze import IDocumentMap
>>> IDocumentMap.providedBy(doc_map)
True

Create an entity and add it to the document map
>>> entity = createObject('sparc.entity.entity', id='abc', name=u'test')
>>> d_id = doc_map.add(entity.getId())

Do a few tests to make sure we can look it up ok
>>> doc_map.docid_for_address(entity.getId()) == d_id
True
>>> doc_map.address_for_docid(d_id) == entity.getId()
True
